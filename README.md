# CapStone_Fall16
Summary:
My capstone project assigned to me with two other members to create a website for a business entrepreneur. Judging from my teammates' strengths and weaknesses, I assigned them to the front end of the project while I focused on the backend and database. Without any framework, I have created the backend with PHP and imitated MVC style.

Backend UI:
[View/Login] is where you can get access to the UI of the login for students and admins. Created a master html page and created seperate forms for students, admins, logout, and login.

[View/Admin] is where you can see the dashboard for the admin. It gives you the ability to see the List of admins and students along with edit. Where the PHP and SQL is in the [Controller].

[View/Student] is where you can see the dashboard for the student. It gives the student to fill in their resume which will populate a resume view in [Student_View]. [/Resume_View] is where you can find the seperate PHP files for each part of the resume.
